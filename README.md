# This is a Java algorithms code sample repo from CS I & II
## ee is the eclipse dir. 
* Town_path
   * Created a Graph class  For Graph<V,E>,  V is the vertex type (a Town), E is the edge type (a Road). 
   *stored the graph, using an adjacent matrix as Set<Town> and Set<Road>. Due to specifications of the project.
   * The program uses a GUI to interface with user.
   * you can also load data from a file in this format "road-name,miles;town-name; town-name".
   * Finally the programe uses Dijkstra shortest path to find the shortest between two nodes if possible.
* DS 
   * This has all the java generic data structures that are past Link list.
* Cyber Ciphers 
   * This program allows Caeser and Bellos Ciphers Encryption and Decryption 
* DoubleLinkLists 
   * Has a sorted and unsorted double linklist generic ofcourse 
* FixExpressions 
   * A GUI program that uses stacks and queues to convert infix to postfix expressions and vice versa and can evalute them. 
 * Sales Report
